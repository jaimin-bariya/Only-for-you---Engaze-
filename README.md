I noticed on the home screen, when content is still loading, it just shows "Loading..." aligned to the left. To improve user experience, Iâ€™d suggest:

Center-align the loading message with some padding or spacing to make it visually balanced.

Even better â€” maybe replace it with a circular loading spinner or animated icon to show it's actively loading.

While checking the web app, I noticed that sensitive internal logs (like otherUserProfileData, allConnections, etc.) are still being printed in the browser console â€” even on the production build (as seen in the screenshot).
